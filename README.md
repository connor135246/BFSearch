## Errors
 If you know of any errors in the source data used, please let me know!  
 
 Known Errors:  
 - **Battle Hall Flareon** - Unlike every other Pokemon in the Battle Frontier, Battle Hall Flareon does not have 510 EVs. I think this may be an error in the source data, but I don't know the true EV spread. If you know the truth about Battle Hall Flareon, please let me know!
